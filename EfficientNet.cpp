/*
EfficientNet is a family of convolutional neural networks designed to achieve high accuracy while being computationally efficient. Here are the key details of its architecture:

1. **Compound Scaling**: EfficientNet uses a compound scaling method that uniformly scales the network's depth, width, and resolution based on a fixed set of scaling coefficients. This allows for better performance without excessive computational costs.

2. **Base Model**: The architecture starts with a baseline model (EfficientNet-B0) that is optimized for accuracy and efficiency. Subsequent models (B1 to B7) are scaled versions of this base model.

3. **Depthwise Separable Convolutions**: Instead of standard convolutions, EfficientNet employs depthwise separable convolutions, which split the convolution operation into two layers: a depthwise convolution and a pointwise convolution. This reduces the number of parameters and computations.

4. **Squeeze-and-Excitation Blocks**: These blocks are integrated into the architecture to improve the representational power of the network. They adaptively recalibrate channel-wise feature responses by explicitly modeling interdependencies between channels.

5. **Swish Activation Function**: EfficientNet uses the Swish activation function, which is defined as \( f(x) = x \cdot \text{sigmoid}(x) \). This function has been shown to improve performance compared to traditional activation functions like ReLU.

6. **Global Average Pooling**: Instead of fully connected layers, EfficientNet uses global average pooling before the final classification layer, which reduces the number of parameters and helps prevent overfitting.

7. **Multi-Scale Training**: The models are trained on images of different resolutions, which helps improve their robustness and performance across various input sizes.

Overall, EfficientNet achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on image classification tasks while being more efficient in terms of parameters and computation compared to previous architectures.
