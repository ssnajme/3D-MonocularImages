## Features
- Monocular depth estimation using state-of-the-art methods.
- Knowledge extraction techniques to improve depth accuracy.
- Optimized for performance using C++.
- Easy to use and extend for research purposes.

## Requirements
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- C++11 or higher
- OpenCV
- Eigen
- CMake

You can install OpenCV and Eigen using the following commands:
```bash
sudo apt-get install libopencv-dev
sudo apt-get install libeigen3-dev
```

## Installation
To set up this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/monocular-depth-estimation.git
   cd monocular-depth-estimation
   ```

2. Create a build directory and compile the project:
   ```bash
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake ..
   make
   ```

## Usage
To use the monocular depth estimation algorithm, follow these instructions:

1. Prepare your input image (e.g., an RGB image to estimate depth).
2. Run the depth estimation executable with the image path as an argument:
   ```bash
   ./DepthEstimator ../path/to/your/image.jpg
   ```

3. The output depth map will be saved in the designated output directory.

## Dataset
For training and testing, you can use the following datasets:
- [NYU Depth Dataset V2](https://cs.nyu.edu/~silberman/datasets/nyu_depth_v2.html)
- [KITTI Dataset](http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/eval_scene_flow.php?Benchmark=depth)

Ensure that you preprocess the datasets according to the requirements of the project.

## Results
The project has been tested on various images, and preliminary results show promising depth estimations. Below are a few examples of input images and their corresponding depth maps:

| Input Image | Depth Map |
|-------------|-----------|
| ![Input](input_image_example.png) | ![Depth](output_depth_example.png) |
